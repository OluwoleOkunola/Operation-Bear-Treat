<h1>Operation Bear Treat</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project features an arms dealer who has been financing terrorist attacks to help acquire the last components necessary to build a nuclear bomb. This includes the latest attack on a French power plant where the terrorists were able to make off with a nuclear centrifuge which will be used to create the nuclear weapon. The mission is to retrieve the list of his recent banking transactions in order to identify and locate the terrorist organizations before they are able to complete the weapon.
